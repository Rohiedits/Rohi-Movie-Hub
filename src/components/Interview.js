     </p>
     <h2 style={{color:"green"}}>Answer Key</h2>
     <p >
1.C's popularity for system-level programming stems from its close relation to machine language, offering developers exceptional control over memory and performance, making it highly efficient for hardware interactions. This is why it’s still preferred by many for system-level programming.<br/>
2.C is a middle-level language because it combines features of both low-level languages, such as direct hardware interaction through pointers and memory management, and high-level languages, like control structures and machine independence, enabling a balance between performance and ease of use.<br/>
3.The three main categories of data types in C are primitive, derived, and user-defined. Examples include int (primitive), arrays (derived), and struct (user-defined).<br/>
4.Tokens are the smallest meaningful elements in C, which the compiler understands. Examples include keywords (e.g., int), operators (e.g., +), and identifiers (e.g., variable names).<br/>
5.The scope of a variable refers to the region of the program where the variable is accessible. The two main types of scope in C are global scope, where a variable is accessible throughout the program, and local scope, where a variable is only accessible within a specific function or block.<br/>
6.Header files in C act as toolkits that provide ready-made functions and features, such as libraries, data types, and macros, saving time and making code more readable by avoiding having to write everything from scratch.<br/>
7.malloc allocates a specific amount of memory in bytes and does not initialise it, whereas calloc allocates memory for an array of elements and initialises all elements to zero.
8.Static variables in C retain their values even after going out of scope, unlike regular variables that are reset every time a function is called. They are initialised only once and retain their value across multiple function calls, and are stored in the data segment of the memory.<br/>
9.A dangling pointer is a pointer that references memory that has been freed or is no longer valid. A common cause of this is when memory is deallocated with free, but the pointer still holds the old memory address.
10.Call-by-value passes a copy of the variable's value to a function, meaning changes inside the function do not affect the original variable. Call-by-reference passes the memory address of the variable, so changes inside the function directly modify the original variable.<br/>
<h2>Essay Questions</h2>
1.Discuss the importance of dynamic memory allocation in C, and explain how malloc, calloc, and free contribute to efficient memory management.<br/>
2.Compare and contrast the use of macros and functions in C, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages, and provide examples of situations where one might be preferred over the other.<br/>
3.Explain the concept of recursion and its applications in C programming. Describe a scenario where recursion would be a suitable approach and provide an example code snippet.<br/>
4.Discuss the difference between static and dynamic memory allocation in C, considering their impact on memory management, program efficiency, and scalability.<br/>
5.Analyse the use of pointers in C, illustrating their versatility and potential pitfalls, such as dangling pointers and memory leaks. Consider the advantages they bring and strategies to mitigate possible issues.<br/>

<h2 style={{color:"blue"}}>Glossary of Key Terms</h2>
<dl class="glossary">
<strong>Call by Reference</strong>: A method of passing parameters to a function where the memory address of the variable is passed. Modifications to the variable within the function directly affect the original variable.<br/>

<h2>Python Interview Preparation Guide</h2>
<h3>Instructions: Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.</h3>
<p style={{color:'blue'}}>
1.What are three key features of Python that distinguish it from other programming languages?<br/>
2.Explain what it means for Python to be an interpreted language.<br/>
3.What are three significant differences between Python lists and tuples?<br/>
4.Differentiate between mutable and immutable data types in Python, providing examples.<br/>
5.Describe the differences between slicing and indexing in Python.<br/>
6.What is list comprehension and why is it considered useful in Python?<br/>
7.Explain the difference in functionality between the break and continue statements in Python.<br/>
8.Describe the purpose and common use case of the pass statement in Python.<br/>
9.What is scope in Python, and what are its two main types?<br/>
10.What are negative indices, and how can they be used in Python?<br/>
</p>

<h2>Answer Key</h2>
1.Python is an interpreted, dynamically-typed, and high-level language. Its dynamic typing allows variable data types to be determined at runtime, while its high-level nature makes the language more readable, and allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than hardware management.<br/>
2.As an interpreted language, Python executes code line by line, unlike compiled languages. This makes Python easier to debug since errors can be located more easily, as opposed to compiling a whole program before finding issues.<br/>
3.Lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed after creation, whereas tuples are immutable. Lists typically use more memory than tuples, and while lists are better for insertion and deletion, tuples have faster iteration.<br/>
4.Mutable data types, like lists and dictionaries, can be modified after they are created; for example, elements can be added, removed, or changed. Immutable data types, such as tuples, strings and integers, cannot be modified after creation; instead, a new object must be created.<br/>
5.Indexing accesses a specific element in a sequence by its position, while slicing accesses a range of elements by specifying start, stop, and step values. Indexing is a way to grab a single element from the sequence, while slicing is used to grab a subset of elements from the sequence.<br/>
6.List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list from an existing one by applying conditions or transformations. It provides a more readable and efficient alternative to traditional for loops, making code shorter and easier to understand.<br/>
7.The break statement terminates the innermost loop it is located within, transferring control to the statement that immediately follows the loop. In contrast, the continue statement skips the current iteration of a loop and moves the control flow to the next iteration of that loop.<br/>
8.The pass statement serves as a placeholder that does nothing when executed, often used in situations where a block of code is required syntactically but no action is needed yet. It prevents the program from raising errors when a section of code is left empty.<br/>
9.Scope in Python defines where variables and functions are accessible in a program, and there are two main types: global and local scope. Global variables can be accessed anywhere in a program, while local variables are limited to the function or block they are defined in.<br/>
10.Negative indices are used to access elements from the end of a sequence, where -1 represents the last element, -2 represents the second-to-last element, and so on. This feature is convenient when working with the end of a sequence without needing to know its length.<br/>
<h2>Essay Questions</h2>
<h3>Instructions: Answer the following essay questions using the appropriate essay format.</h3>

1.Discuss the concepts of shallow copy and deep copy in Python. Explain how they work, and provide scenarios where each is most useful.<br/>
2.Describe how arguments are passed in Python, and discuss the impact of mutability on this process. Explain the distinction between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference, and how Python's approach is different.<br/>
3.Explain the concepts of generators and decorators in Python. Provide use cases of each, and discuss how each one makes code more efficient or readable.<br/>
4.Compare and contrast the object-oriented programming principles of abstraction and encapsulation. Provide examples of how each is implemented and demonstrate in Python.<br/>
5.Explain the differences between method overriding and method overloading. Discuss the role of each one in implementing polymorphism, and explain which approach Python uses.<br/>
