    <h2>Quiz</h2>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer the following questions in 2-3 sentences each.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Why is Java not considered a pure object-oriented programming language?</strong></li>
        <p>Java is not considered a pure object-oriented language because it uses primitive data types like int and char that are not objects. Additionally, the use of the static keyword allows methods and variables to be accessed without creating objects, which is against the strict object-oriented principle.</p>

        <li><strong>Describe the role of the JVM, JRE, and JDK in running a Java program.</strong></li>
        <p>The JDK (Java Development Kit) provides the tools to write and compile Java code. The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is needed to run the compiled bytecode, and includes the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). The JVM interprets and executes the bytecode, ensuring platform independence.</p>

        <li><strong>What makes Java a platform-independent language?</strong></li>
        <p>Java achieves platform independence by compiling source code into bytecode, which is platform-agnostic. The JVM then interprets this bytecode for the specific operating system, allowing Java applications to run on any system with a JVM. This is described as "write once, run anywhere."</p>

        <li><strong>How does Java's string pool improve memory usage and efficiency?</strong></li>
        <p>The string pool is a memory area where Java stores string literals. When a string is created, Java checks if it exists in the pool; if it does, the existing reference is reused, saving memory. It also makes string comparisons faster.</p>

        <li><strong>What is the purpose of wrapper classes in Java and give an example?</strong></li>
        <p>Wrapper classes convert primitive data types into objects, allowing them to be used in contexts that require objects, like collections. For example, the Integer class wraps the primitive type int. This allows methods like valueOf() to be used.</p>

        <li><strong>Explain how the Java Collections Framework can be used to manage an online bookstore's data?</strong></li>
        <p>The Java Collections Framework provides data structures like ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap. ArrayList can store a dynamic list of books, a HashSet can efficiently maintain unique genres, and a HashMap can map authors to lists of their books. This framework makes data management more efficient.</p>

        <li><strong>What is the difference between the this and super keywords in Java?</strong></li>
        <p>The this keyword refers to the current instance of a class and is used to access the current object’s properties and methods. The super keyword refers to the parent class and is used to access overridden methods and properties from the parent class.</p>

        <li><strong>Explain the key differences between static methods and instance methods in Java.</strong></li>
        <p>Static methods belong to a class itself and can be called without creating an object. Instance methods belong to an object of the class and must be called on an instance of that object. Static methods can only access static members, while instance methods can access both static and instance members, as well as using this.</p>

        <li><strong>What are constructors in Java and explain the two main types?</strong></li>
        <p>Constructors are special methods used to initialise objects of a class and they have the same name as the class. There are two main types: default constructors, which take no arguments and are automatically created if none are explicitly defined, and parameterised constructors, which accept arguments to initialise object properties.</p>

        <li><strong>How do method overloading and method overriding differ in Java?</strong></li>
        <p>Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in the superclass, and the method signature (name and parameters) must remain the same.</p>
    </ol>

    <h2>Essay Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer these questions in a well-structured essay format.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Discuss the benefits and drawbacks of Java's platform independence, using examples from the sources to support your arguments. How does the JVM make this possible?</li>
        <li>Explain the role of the Java Collections Framework and how it facilitates efficient data management. What are the common data structures used in Java for handling data, and where would they be best suited in common program tasks?</li>
        <li>Compare and contrast the use cases for StringBuffer and StringBuilder. In what situations would each be most appropriate and why?</li>
        <li>Discuss the significance of abstraction and interfaces in Java. Provide examples of how both are used to achieve code reusability and flexibility in software design.</li>
        <li>Explain the concept of exception handling in Java. Why is it essential, and how do try, catch, and finally blocks contribute to a robust software?</li>

        <h2>Quiz</h2>
        <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer each question in 2-3 sentences.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>What is the fundamental difference between a DBMS and an RDBMS?</strong></li>
            <p>A DBMS (Database Management System) stores data in individual files without connections, while an RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) organizes data into tables with relationships, enabling faster data retrieval.</p>

            <li><strong>Explain the role of a primary key in a database table.</strong></li>
            <p>A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring no duplicate or empty values. It is like a unique ID for each row, allowing for specific identification of records.</p>

            <li><strong>How does a foreign key establish relationships between tables?</strong></li>
            <p>A foreign key establishes a link between two tables by referencing the primary key in another table. This allows related data in different tables to be connected and referenced.</p>

            <li><strong>Describe two types of constraints used in SQL, providing examples of each.</strong></li>
            <p>NOT NULL ensures that a column cannot be empty, such as a role_number field in a student table. UNIQUE ensures that values in a column are distinct, like an email address column in a student table.</p>

            <li><strong>What are DDL commands used for, and give two examples?</strong></li>
            <p>DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to define the structure of the database, including creating, altering, or deleting tables. Examples include CREATE TABLE and ALTER TABLE.</p>

            <li><strong>What is the purpose of DML commands, and give two examples?</strong></li>
            <p>DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to manage the actual data within the database tables. Examples include INSERT INTO, UPDATE, and DELETE.</p>

            <li><strong>Distinguish between the DELETE, TRUNCATE, and DROP statements.</strong></li>
            <p>DELETE removes specific rows from a table based on a condition and allows for rollback. TRUNCATE removes all rows quickly, without the option to rollback. DROP removes the table structure completely.</p>

            <li><strong>How do GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses alter query results?</strong></li>
            <p>GROUP BY groups rows with the same values in a specified column, allowing aggregate functions to be applied to each group, creating summaries, while ORDER BY sorts the query result based on values in a column.</p>

            <li><strong>What are aggregate functions and provide two examples?</strong></li>
            <p>Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple values to return a single result, like COUNT() which counts the number of rows or values and AVG() which calculates the average value of a column.</p>

            <li><strong>Explain what indexing does and why it is important for databases.</strong></li>
            <p>Indexing organizes and labels data within a table to quickly locate specific rows without scanning the entire database, improving data retrieval speed and efficiency.</p>
