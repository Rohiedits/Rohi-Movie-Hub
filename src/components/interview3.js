     <h1>Excel Mastery: A Comprehensive Study Guide</h1>

<h2>Short-Answer Quiz</h2>
<div class="quiz-section">
    <h3>1. What is the primary distinction between an absolute and a relative cell reference in Excel?</h3>
    <p>An absolute cell reference remains fixed when copied to other cells, denoted by dollar signs ($) before column letters or row numbers (e.g., $A$1). A relative cell reference adjusts based on the new location when a formula is copied (e.g., A1).</p>

    <h3>2. Describe the core purpose of the VLOOKUP function and its essential parameters.</h3>
    <p>The VLOOKUP function searches for a value in the first column of a table array and returns a value in the same row from a specified column. The key parameters include the lookup value, table array, column index number, and range lookup (true for approximate match, false for exact match).</p>

    <h3>3. How can you use conditional formatting to highlight cells with values exceeding 100?</h3>
    <p>Select the cells, navigate to conditional formatting, choose 'Highlight Cells Rules', select 'Greater Than', enter '100', and choose the desired format. This will apply the chosen formatting to all cells with values greater than 100.</p>

    <h3>4. What is the function of the wildcard characters (*, ?, ~) in Excel?</h3>
    <p>The asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters, the question mark (?) matches exactly one character and the tilde (~) is an escape character, allowing you to search for the literal asterisk or question mark symbols.</p>

    <h3>5. Explain the key functionalities of a pivot table in Excel.</h3>
    <p>A pivot table is an interactive tool used to summarise, analyse, and present large datasets by reorganising data dynamically. It enables users to group, filter, and calculate data such as sums, averages, and percentages without changing the original data.</p>

    <h3>6. Using the IF function, how would you construct a formula to check if a number is greater than 75 and return either "Pass" or "Fail"?</h3>
    <p>The formula would be: <code>=IF(cell&gt;75,"Pass","Fail")</code>, where "cell" is the reference to the cell containing the number. If the number in the specified cell is greater than 75, the formula returns "Pass"; otherwise, it returns "Fail".</p>

    <h3>7. Define "macros" in Excel and their role in automating repetitive tasks.</h3>
    <p>Macros are recorded sequences of actions or scripts (written in VBA), that allow users to automate repetitive tasks by executing multiple steps with a single click. This includes applying formatting, manipulating data, and performing calculations.</p>

    <h3>8. Outline the primary limitations of VLOOKUP when dealing with large data sets or multiple criteria.</h3>
    <p>VLOOKUP can be slow with large data sets due to linear searching and volatile calculations, and it is limited by its fixed column index, one-way searching (right only), case insensitivity, and inability to handle multiple criteria.</p>

    <h3>9. Demonstrate the syntax of a nested IF function used to assign grades based on scores (e.g., A for 90+, B for 75-89, C for 70-74).</h3>
    <p>The formula would be: <code>=IF(cell&gt;=90,"A",IF(cell&gt;=75,"B",IF(cell&gt;=70,"C","")))</code>, where "cell" is the reference to the cell containing the score. This function evaluates the conditions sequentially.</p>

    <h3>10. What is the primary purpose of inferential statistics and how can Excel assist in its application?</h3>
    <p>Inferential statistics makes predictions about a population based on a sample, tests hypotheses and generalises findings, and provides a foundation for data-driven decisions. Excel can perform a T-Test, which is used to compare the means of two groups, as well as many other statistical tests using the Analysis Toolpak.</p>

<h2>Essay Questions</h2>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Answer Key</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>OOP is a programming paradigm centred around organising code around objects. These objects contain both data (attributes) and behaviours (methods), making it easier to manage complex programmes.</li>
    <li>A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class, representing a real-world entity with its own unique properties and behaviour.</li>
    <li>The four pillars of OOP are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.</li>
    <li>Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, such as a class. This helps to protect data by hiding it from external access, improving security.</li>
    <li>Abstraction involves showing only essential information to the outside world while hiding the complex implementation details. For example, when driving a car, you use the accelerator and brake without knowing how the engine works.</li>
    <li>Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass). It enables code reusability by allowing subclasses to reuse the code from the superclass without starting from scratch.</li>
    <li>Constructor chaining is the process of one constructor calling another within the same class or its parent class. This is done to reuse code and avoid duplication when initialising an object and is normally used with <code>this</code> and <code>super</code> keywords in the program code.</li>
    <li>Access specifiers are keywords that define the visibility or accessibility of a class, variable, method or constructor. Public members can be accessed from anywhere; private members can only be accessed within the same class, and protected members can be accessed within the same package or by subclasses in other packages.</li>
    <li>A shallow copy copies the references of the object, meaning two references point to a single memory location. A deep copy creates a new object with its own memory, ensuring that each object has independent data.</li>
    <li>An interface in Java is a reference type that contains only abstract methods and constant variables. It provides a blueprint for classes to follow, achieving abstraction and allowing for multiple inheritances of functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Essay Questions</h2>
  <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Answer each question in the form of an essay, drawing upon your understanding of the source material.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Discuss the importance of object-oriented programming (OOP) in modern software development and provide real-world examples to support your points.</li>
    <li>Explain the four pillars of object-oriented programming (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism) and how they each contribute to the design of efficient and maintainable software.</li>
    <li>Compare and contrast static polymorphism (method overloading) with dynamic polymorphism (method overriding), explaining how each is used in OOP design.</li>
    <li>Discuss the concept of coupling in OOP, differentiating between tight and loose coupling, and explain why loose coupling is generally preferred in software development.</li>
    <li>Explain the different types of inheritance (single, multilevel, hierarchical, and multiple) and discuss how each can be used to design different types of class structures.</li>
  </ul>
